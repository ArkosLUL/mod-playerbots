// Three phases in three different rooms. P1 is tentacles and Ominous Clouds around the central
// platform; P2 opens the brain room below, where the raid splits between killing tentacles above and
// clearing illusions - Stormwind, Icecrown and the Chamber of Aspects - inside the brain; P3 is the
// boss himself on the platform once the Shadow Barrier drops and the last Guardian is down.
//
// Sanity (63050) is the currency underneath all of it: it drains on gaze and illusion exposure, and
// at zero the bot is Insane and lost. That is why the geometry below is per-room rather than one
// arena, and why phase is read off the boss's aura rather than a timer.
