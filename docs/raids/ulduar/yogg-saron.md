# Yogg-Saron
## Reduced Keepers

The raid frees fewer than 4 Keepers, losing that Keeper's support. Tuned for the hardest single-Keeper
case, **Thorim only**. The bitmask lives in `PERSISTENT_DATA_WATCHERS_MASK` — preferred over Sara's
`GetData(DATA_GET_KEEPERS_COUNT)`, which gives a count only, because reading the mask confirms
**which** Keeper.

What Thorim-only removes: no Freya means **no Sanity Wells, so Sanity (63050, 100 stacks) is a
one-way drain** — nothing restores it; no Hodir means no Protective Gaze absorb; no Mimiron means no
haste clouds and therefore a slower kill and more total drain.

Sanity drains, and whether anything can be done:

| Source | Spell | Loss | Avoidable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Psychosis | 63795 / 65301 | −9 / −12 | **No** — random target every 3.5s in P2 |
| Malady of the Mind | 63830 / 63881 | −3 | Yes |
| Brain Link | 63803 | −2 | Yes, if the pair stays within 20 yd |
| Lunatic Gaze (P2 skull) | 64168 | −2 | Yes — only players *facing* the caster |
| Lunatic Gaze (P3 Yogg) | 64164 | −4 | Yes |
| Induce Madness | 64059 | −100 | Yes — leave the brain room |

**Thorim's Titanic Storm auto-kills anything carrying `SPELL_WEAKENED` (64162)**, and a guardian
drops Empowered at ~<10% HP. So **melee only need to burn a guardian to Weakened; Thorim finishes
it.** With no Thorim, guardians are effectively unkillable without the cheat — which is why the P3
cheat instakill is suppressed **only when Thorim is a Keeper**, leaving other reduced-Keeper combos
winnable.

Crusher Tentacle (33966) is **stationary** and nobody tanks it — with no one in melee range its Crush
cannot land, so ranged nuke it in place. Its Diminish Power (64145) is a raid-wide DPS debuff, so it
must die fast.

Open risks: the removed P3 cheat existed because Lunatic Gaze "freezes" bots, so guardian DPS may
stall between gazes; a guardian spawns up to 48 yd out, so confirm taunt pickup is prompt; and the
sanity-conservation behaviour (stand behind Yogg facing away below 15 stacks) **nearly benches a bot**
— sanity never recovers Thorim-only, so a bot that drops to 15 stays there.

## Squeeze breaks on immunity

Removing the Squeeze aura (64125 / 64126) kills the Constrictor Tentacle and drops the passenger, so
`yogg-saron squeeze escape` at `ACTION_RAID + 1` has a grabbed mage cast Ice Block and a paladin cast
Divine Shield. Hunter Feign Death and rogue Vanish are deliberately not used — neither removes a
periodic damage aura.
